# Decentralized Derivatives Index (DDI)
Decentralized Derivatives Index (DDI) is a market capitalization weighted index that tracks the performance of the top decentralized derivatives exchange tokens in crypto. Holders of DDI benefit from letting market forces decide the winners of the sector while delegating the inclusion of new tokens to the index creator.

## Definitions
- **Decentralized exchange**: An exchange where trading is done in a peer-to-peer, and where users have custody over their own funds.
- **Derivative**: Any token that tracks the price of another token is a derivative. However, as DDI is designed to track the performance of decentralized exchanges where crypto variants of classical leveraged derivatives such as futures, swaps, and options are traded, governance tokens of synthetic asset protocols are omitted.


## Token selection
To qualify for inclusion:

- The token must be a governance token (or similar) of a decentralized derivatives exchange where derivatives are being traded,
- The token must be an ERC-20 token,
- The token must have a market cap > $20 million,
- The token must have had daily liquidity > $0.5 million for a sustained period of 7 days, and
- The token must not be considered a security.


## Initial tokens
The following tokens were a part of the index at launch:
1. Perpetaual Protocol (PERP)
2. Hegic (HEGIC)
3. MCDEX (MCB)
4. FutureS

_DerivaDAO (DDX) was an initial component, but later omitted because of liquidity considerations_.

## New tokens
When a new token meets the selection requirements, it is added to the index within 30 days of fulfilling said requirements.

## Reweighting
When a new token is added to the index, relative weights will be recalculated based on each tokens market capitalization.

The index methodology may be changed without prior notice.
